# Encrypted-Chat-System

This chat system was build as part of my Assignment for Information Security Course during my 7th semseter. 
## Key features include: 
1. Communication through pipes.
2. Encrypted communication.
3. Diffie Hellman key exchange.
4. Hashing of password.
5. Storing hashed password along with username, email and salt value into cred.txt file.

## Future work 
This code is incomplete due to the short deadline. This could be further improved by:

1.Encrypting the whole communication process. Note: Function for AES-128 encryption algorithm has already been implemented just each message needs to passed through it before send to the server.

2.Ensuring registeration process is complete with unique username before the chat proceeds. 

3.Login with correct username, password as stored in the cred.txt file.
